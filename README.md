CPFMove package is designed for facilitating the work with raw GPS data
and especially for species showing a central-place foraging behavior
(CPF i.e. tendancy to an animal to leave and return to a fixed based
between foraging trips, rather than being in constant roaming).

Package can be downloaded using

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("hadley/dplyr")
```

Documentation with basic information on how to use the
CPFMove functions is available at [CPFMove Introduction](https://philbertrand.github.io./)
